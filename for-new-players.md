description: A few notes to get you started with Etterna and tweaktown
---

# For new players

Q: How do I install tweaktown?

A: Download \[link] and extract the **`tweaktown`** folder to **`Etterna\Themes`**. Then in etterna, go to **`Options->Display Options->Appearance Options->Theme`** and select tweaktown



Q: How do I go back to the default theme?

A: From the main menu, go to **`Settings->Graphics`** and choose Rebirth



Q: How do I change my scroll speed?

A: In song select, either **`Press enter twice`**, press the **`Setup button`** next to Preview or press **`Backspace`**. The top option **`C400`** is your scroll speed. If you're coming from osu!mania, you can estimate your usual scroll speed with this formula **`osumania_speed*32`**. Normally you would have to adjust scroll speed according to the receptor size setting, but tweaktown takes care of this scaling automatically.



Q: Where do I get noteskins?

A: Skins can be downloaded from \[link], and if you're playing 4k/6k, they need to be extracted to **`Etterna\NoteSkins\dance`**. Other modes go in different folders like so: 5k=pump, 7k=kb7, 7+1k=beat\
