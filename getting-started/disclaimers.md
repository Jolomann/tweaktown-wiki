# Disclaimers

## **This theme automatically sets your texture resolution to 8192 and forces 16:9 resolutions.**

If you're worried about not being able to play with your preferred resolution, there is a way to get the same playing experience on 16:9 if you're playing in windowed mode.

Close the game and edit **`DisplayHeight`** in **`Save/Preferences.ini`** to match the resolution you're used to. For example, if you're used to **`800x600`**, do **`DisplayHeight=600`**

The height will be whatever you put, and width auto adjusts to match 16:9. Using the height you're used to should feel the same while playing.

If you're using fullscreen and not 16:9 you'll have to wait for other theme versions.





Yes, versions for other aspect ratios are planned. The resolution is limited to make skinning more flexible because the position and scale of elements can stay consistent this way.

Only 16:9 will be supported to start with while things get adjusted and bugs get fixed. After this version is stable and polished, 4:3 and 16:10 are next in line
